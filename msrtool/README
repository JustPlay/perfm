Fixing uncore frequency
    Uncore frequency can be set by writing the same value for both minimum and maximum 
    frequency through MSR 0x620 on each socket.
    
    In MSR 0x620, bits 0-7 indicate the maximum frequency (in units of 100Mhz),
    while bits 8-15 capture the minimum frequency. 

    For example, if you want to set the uncore frequency to 2700 MHz,
    you need to write the value 27 (0x1b in hex) for both max and min frequency.
    So, 0x1b1b would be written to MSR 0x620. 

    ./wrmsr  -a   0x620 0x1b1b 
    ./wrmsr  -p0  0x620 0x1b1b 

Set LLC cache ways
    Cache size is controlled by reducing the number of ways in each set.
    By default, we have 20 ways in each cache set.
    The following recipe is used to cut the # of ways down thus reducing the available total cache size.


    ./rdmsr -a 0xc8f
    ./rdmsr -a 0xc90

    将Cache的默认20Way(0xfffff, 20bits setted)修改为15Way(0x7fff, 15bits setted)
    ./wrmsr -a 0xc8f 0           1. Write 0 to msr 0xc8f on all cores
    ./wrmsr -a 0xc90 0x7fff      2. Write <X> to msr 0xc90 on all the cores

     a. The default value for <X> is 0xfffff (one bit set for each of the 20 ways of the set).
        By setting this value lower, you can disable cache ways and reduce the size.
        For example to reduce the cache size to 1/4 the size, the # of ways should be cut from 20 to 5. 
        That would be writing 0x1F to msr 0xc90.
     b. The above write should be done only once and if additional sizes are needed, a reboot is recommended 
        (where in you will set the new value after the reboot)
     c. Note that <X> value should have contiguous bits set i.e 0xFF is ok while 0xF0F is not ok
